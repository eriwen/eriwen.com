A lot of people I know use [JetBrains IDEs](http://www.jetbrains.com/) for development,
but it seems like few have heard of my absolute favorite plugin: **Key promoter**.
In this post I tell you why you should install and use it right now.

## Remember Those Keybindings!
Key promoter is a plugin for all of the IDEs including [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/),
[RubyMine](http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/), [WebStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)
and more.

reminds you of the keyboard shortcut for an action that you perform with
your mouse. This is a very useful way to learn those keyboard shortcuts and keep your
hands on your keyboard. If you use your mouse to perform an action that doesn't have a keybinding 3 times,
Key promoter will suggest that you create one.

## Configuring key promoter
Whenever I install it, I always go to the preferences and enable it for everything.

Key promoters default notification is ugly. I think this is actually by design,
because I don't want to keep seeing that ugly thing; yet another incentive to
remember keybindings. Luckily, it's just HTML and totally configurable so you
can have a *ahem* kinder experience.

If you use any JetBrains IDEs, I highly recommend you give Key promoter a try.

Got any IDE plugins you can't live without?

**If you love Key promoter, spread the word!**
