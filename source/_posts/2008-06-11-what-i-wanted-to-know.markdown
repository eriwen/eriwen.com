A couple months ago I was at my Alma Mater [Adams State College](http://www.adams.edu) to talk about what I would have wanted to know if I was a student. I've been out of college for 3 years now, and held 3 VERY different programming jobs since graduating with my Bachelor's Degree. I am hoping to shed some light on what I have learned about the "real world" and clear up some misconceptions.

## Quick background

I just want to give you enough information about where I'm coming from here. Obviously, your experiences will be different but I think there are several things common to almost all workplaces and that is what this post will focus on.

I have done data-oriented programming, back-end programming, and web programming for a couple small companies and one quite large company. All of these positions were around Northern Colorado/Wyoming so we're not exactly in Silicon Valley. If you really care about the details you can check out [my LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eriwen).

## What I would've done differently

There are a few things that I would go back and do if I could:

  * Work with other OSes - I mostly used Windows because that was what we had in most of our labs. I would have been more prepared for the workplace if I had done more stuff in a shell. Go try out Mac or [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/)! **Most of the candidates I see nowadays don't have non-Windows experience, and it is really frickin' valuable, I promise!**
  * More research classes and internships - Do something outside your comfort zone! You can explore things that noone else has and that experience is absolutely invaluable. I really wish I had done the facial-recognition programming class or an internship at a bigger company. Don't make my mistake.
  * Consider taking the SCJA or SCJP exams - My college program was Java-based but there were so many parts of the Java language that I really did not understand. [I really learned a lot from passing the SCJP](/java/how-not-to-pass-the-scjp-exam/) and I seriously recommend taking it as the knowledge WILL set you apart.
  * Connect with more people - I had what I would consider a rougher entrance into the programming world, and I may not have gotten a good programming job ever if I had not met some good companies at university job fairs. **Take advantage of college job fairs outside your college**

## What I wish I'd known about the workplace

<img src="/images/resume.png" alt="Eric Wendelin job resume" class="img-left" />It was certainly different working on the same type of thing for many hours a day instead of the great diversity I had in school. My brain felt tired every day at about 4pm for the first month in the "real world", but I think it's just because I was learning so much.

Another thing I was surprised by is that **people in the workplace seemed more easygoing than I would have thought** and **socialization (face-time) is an important part of working**. All of the places I have worked I would guess that people tend to spend **about 3 hours per week socializing in one way or another**.

I have not had to work more than 50 hours per week during most weeks at any of my jobs, but I have friends that do have short periods where they work 80 hours/wk or more. **You should definitely ask about this during your interviews**, since you don't want to be surprised by this.

**Company/workgroup attitude is the most important factor in how much I succeeded in my work.** One major part of the attitude is trust: the managers/tech leads that trusted their engineers (including newer ones) to produce good work got it so much more than those that did not. Similarly, the groups that recognized that their **engineers are an investment**, and put money toward training etc., got higher quality work and probably more profit. **When you interview with an engineer, ask how long it was since the company paid for training.**

**The best job is not usually the best-paying job**. You need to factor in benefits as well as intangibles (e.g. can I work from home? etc.) and really think hard about it because it affects your happiness significantly.

## What I didn't expect to help me

Things that I didn't think would matter so much but ended up driving a lot of my success:

  * Joined clubs **outside** of engineering - this helped me with my social skills a LOT and helped me become a better team member.
  * Summer internship that forced me to use computing languages that I had not touched before: Perl, PHP, and other CL tools in a mostly command-line Linux environment - Going outside your comfort zone ended up being HUGE in my career because I realized how to pick up technologies and try to build something useful with them.

## What I thought mattered and didn't

  * GPA? - nope, except that it will allow you to go to graduate school
  * General eduation classes? - do matter somewhat, because you have to be able to think like your diverse user base and this helps you put you in someone else's shoes.
  * Who you know? - Yes! I had no idea how much knowing someone from a company would really boost your chances of succeeding.

## Summary: Do these things to prepare yourself

  * Go download another OS like [OpenSolaris](http://opensolaris.org/index.html) or [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/)
  * Connect with others. Go to your local JUG. Join [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/).
  * Make a good list of questions to ask potential employers
  * Take extra classes in technology
  * Apply for an internship, even if you don't get it or want it
  * Learn something outside of the required courses
  * Consider blogging and/or mentoring

I have compiled a random list of [job links](http://del.icio.us/emwendelin/jobs) that I think are helpful. Hope they are!

If you are a professional now, share what helped you or what you didn't expect. I've only shared my views and yours would be extra helpful to those who need it!
